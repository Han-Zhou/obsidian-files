$$f(c)$$
$\pi r^2$, $\Sigma$, $\Delta$, $\int$, 
$\frac{2}{3}$. 
$\sum$, $\aleph$, $a_n$, $e^x$

\begin{theorem} This is not really a theorem.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} Well, it's not, right?
\end{proof}
Here are some things you might want to typeset: $\sum$, $\aleph$, $a_n$, $e^x$, $\pi r^2$, $\Sigma$, $\Delta$, $\int$, 
$\frac{2}{3}$. 
Probably there's more stuff.  You can always go to detexify.org to try to discover commands.  Maybe I want to add a lot of space.

Is this enough? Let $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{Z}$ be the map given by $f(x) = \lfloor x\rfloor$.  Show that
$f(\pi)=3$.

Welcome to MATH 145.  If I want to write Greek letters I can, if I use mathmode. To do that I have to enclose things between dollar signs like this: $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta,\ldots$.  If I want to display it, I should use double dollar signs:
$$\int_0^1 f(x)\, dx = 4.$$
