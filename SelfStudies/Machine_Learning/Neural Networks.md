inspired by the brain.

*Neuron* : a thing that holds a number
"Activation"

*Layers*
"Hidden layers"


<u>How it operates:</u>
Activations in one layer determines the activation of another layer


Weights


Signoid function (squeezes output between 0 and 1)


Bias: for inactivate; ( how high the weights need to be before the outputs become meaninglessly active)





**Network** -> function
