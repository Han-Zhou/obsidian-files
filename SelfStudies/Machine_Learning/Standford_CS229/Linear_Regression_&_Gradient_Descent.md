process of supervised learning:
- Training Set -> Learning Algorithm -> Output a function to make predictions
- Outputs Hypothesis (h)
- h takes an input and produces a prediction


How to represent h?  
$h(x)=\theta_0 + \theta_1x_1 + \theta_2x_2$  
$x_1 = size$  
$x_2 = number of bedrooms$
\


In general,  
$$h(x) = \sum_{j=0}^2\theta_jx_j$$  
where $x_0 = 1$
