<u>Recall</u>:
```c++
void push_back(const T &x) {
	increaseCap();
	new(vb.v + n) T(x); // if this throws, have the same vector
	++n;
}
```

What if increaseCap throws?
```c++
void increaseCap() {
	if (n == vb.cap) {
		vector.base vb2{2 * vb.cap} // RAII
		uninitialized_copy(vb2.v, vb2.v + n, vb.v) // Strong guarantee
		int m = n;
		clear();
		std::swap(sb, sb2);
		n = m;
	}
}
```

<u>Note</u>: only try blocks we use are in `uninitialized_copy` and `uninitialized_fill`

But - we have an efficiency issue - copying from the old array to the new one.
-> moving would be better!
-> But moving destroys the old copy, so if an exception is thrown, our vector is corrupted.
Thus we can only move if we are sure that the move operation is nothrow.
```c++
void increaseCap() {
	...
	uninitialized_copy_or_move(vb2.v, vb2.v + n, wv.v);
	...
}

template <typename T> 
	void uninitialized_copy_or_move(T *start, T *finish, T *source) {
	T *p;
	try {
		for (p = start; p != finish; ++p) {
			new (p) T(std::move_if_noexcept(*(source + p - start)));
		}
	}	
	catch (...) { // will never happen if T has a non-throwing move constructor
		for (; p != start; --p) {
			(p - 1)->~T();
		}
		throw;
	}
}
```

`std::move_if_noexcept(x)`
- produces `std::move(x)` if x has a non-throwing move constructor.
- produces x otherwise
But how should the compiler know if T's move constructor is non-throwing?
You have to tell it.
```c++
class C {
public:
	C(C &&other) noexcept;
	...
}
```

*In general*: moves + swaps should be non-throwing.
Declare them so - allow more optimized code to run.
Any function that you are sure will never emit an exception, you should declare noexcept.

<u>Q</u>: Is `std::swap` noexcept?
```c++
template <typename T> void swap(T &a, T &b) ___? {
	T c{std::move(a)};
	n = std::move(b);
	b = std::move(c);
}
```
<u>Ans</u>: only if T has a noexcept move constructor/assignment 
How do we specify this?
```c++
template <typename T> void swap(T &a, T &b)
	noexcept (std::is_nothrow_move_constructible<T>::value && std::is_nothrow_move_assignable<T>::value) {
	...	
}
```



# Problem 18: The Middle

If we want to insert an item into the <u>middle</u> of a collection - say by index
For vectors:
- easy to find the place to insert
- shuffling cost (unavoidable)
For lists:
- finding the insertion point requires linear search
- no shuffling cost
Using iterators instead of indices should be about the same for vectors and faster for lists.

```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
	...
public:
	iterator insert(iterator posn, const T &x) {
		ptrdiff_t offset = posn - begin();
		increaseCap();
		posn = begin() + offset;
		if (n > 0)
			new (end()) T(std::move_if_noexcept(*(end() - 1)));
		++n;
		for (iterator it = end() - 1; it != posn; --it) {
			*it = std::move_if_noexcept(*(it - 1));
		}
		*posn = x;
		return posn;
	}
}
```

<u>Exception safe?</u>
Assuming T's copy/move constructor + copy/move assignment are exception safe (at least basic guarantee), insert offers the basic guarantee.
-> may got a partially-shuffled vector, but it will be a valid vector.

<u>Note</u>: if you have other iterators pointing at the vector:
![[IMG_1973.jpg]]
it2 will now point at a different item.

<u>Convention</u>: after a call to insert or erase, all iterators pointing after the point of the insertion or erasure are considered invalid + should not be used.
<u>Similarly</u> - if a reallocation happens, <u>all</u> iterators pointing at the vector can become invalid.
<u>Exercises</u> - erase, emplace



<u>BUT</u> - that means there's a problem with push_back. If placement new throws, the vector is the same, but iterators might have been invalidated!

<u>To fix</u>: Don't throw away the old array until you have placed the item.
```c++
void push_back(const T &x) {
	if (n == vb.cap) {
		vector_base vb2{2 * vb.cap};
		new (vb2.v + b) T(x);
		try {
			uninitialized_copy_or_move(vb2.v, vb2.v + n, vb.v);
		}
		catch (...) {
			(vb2.v + n)->~T();
			throw;
		}
		int m = n;
		clear();
		swap(vb, vb2);
		n = m + 1;
	}
	else {...}
}
```

# Problem 19: A case study in strings

So, if a string is a sequence of chars ... can we just use `vector<char>` when we want strings?
<u>Ans</u>: Yes, in principle, but there might be some reasons not to.

Primarily, vector functions as a container of items that may not have much to do with each other.

But in a string, it's the elements taken together as a group that makes a string what it is.
<u>E.g.</u> strings are more likely than vectors to:
- be appended to one another
- be compared lexicographically
- be searched for a substring
- have a substring extracted
All of these are about chars in the sequence, in conjunction with their neighbours.
So a string would likely support a different interface from vector.
