Let's talk about strings ...
There are different kinds of characters 
	- char (8 bits)
	- but there are wider characters
=> string is a template parameterized by character type
	- we will stick with char and not write a template.

No matter what the character type is, they all have one thing in common - they are a base type, not a class.
So not constructors/destructors. No placement new needed.

Simple implementation:
```c++
class string {
	size_t length, cap;
	char *theString;
};
```

<u>Q</u>: Do we still need null termination?
<u>A</u>: No, but also kind of.

We have a length field now to tell us how long the string is.
<u>Advantage</u>: There can be \0s in the middle of the string!
<u>But</u>: We do need to be able to interface with functions expecting `char*` s.
```c++
class string {
	...
public:
	const char *c_str();
	// returns an equivalent C-style string in O(1) time
}
```
For this to work, the `char*` should be null-terminated.
So we still need `theString[length] == '\0'` even though we don't need this condition to determine length.

<u>Note</u>: If our string does contain `'\0'`s (not as terminators), the `char*` returned by c-str will be interpreted as ending at the first `\0`
```c++
const char *string::c_str(){ return theString;}
```



*Comparison (lexicographic)*:
C: `strcmp` - direct comparison was comparison of pointers

Since string is a class, we can define `operator<`, `operator<=`, etc. for it.
`strcmp(s1,s2) < 0` ------> `s1 < s2` - more natural

But `strcmp` had one advantage over `operator<`: it is 3-valued.
So we can write:
```c++
char *s1, char *s2;
...
auto result = strcmp(s1, s2);
if (result < 0) { ... }
else if (result == 0) { ... }
else { ... }
// one string comparison
```
v.s.
```c++
string s1, s2;
if (s1 < s2) { ... }
else if (s1 == s2) { ... }
else { ... }
// two comparisons - mostly the same steps, done twice
```


If we want to compete with C, we need a 3-valued comparison operator.
```c++
import <compare>
operator<=>
```
The standard provides a class `std::strong_ordering` 
and constants `std::strong_ordering::{less, equal, greater}`
that we can use a the result of comparisons.
	These constants compare, respectively as `{<, ==, >}`

By default, `<=>` does lexi comparison for free, if you ask for it.
```c++
class Vec {
	int x, y;
public:
	std::strong_ordering operator<=>(const Vec &other) const = default;
};
```
Or we can write it ourselves:
```c++
class Vec {
	...
	std::strong_ordering operator<=>(const Vec &other) const {
		auto n = x <=> other.x;
		return (n == 0) ? y <=> other.y : n;
	} // equiv. to default
};
```



But for string, the default would do pointer comparison on `theString`, so we need to write our own:
```c++
class string {
	...
	std::strong_ordering operator<=>(const string &other) const {
		for (size_t i = 0; i < min(length, other.length); ++i) {
			if (theString[i] != other.theString[i])
				return theString[i]<=>other.theString[i];
		}
		return len <=> other.len;
	}
};
```


This also gets us `s1 < s2`, etc. for free.
`s1 < s2` rewritten b y the compiler as `(s1 <=> s2) < 0`

But we have a small problem with (in)equality:
	- Always does a linear scan
	- Strings of different lengths cannot be equal.

<u>Solution</u>: Write a specialized `operator==` (exercise)
	- compare lengths first
	- then do linear scan
C++ will use this for both `==` and `!=`.




*Optimizing the representation*

One thing we know about chars vs. Ts - they're small (one byte)
A lot of strings are small too.
![[IMG_2797.jpg]]
- pointer deref => poor locality, seems wasteful when the payoff is one char.
- What if we used a different representation for short strings?

Multiple representations for an object's implementation ... let's talk about unions.
For types T1, T2, 
```c++
union U {
	T1 t1;
	T2 t2;
};
```
is like a struct, but has <u>one</u> of the fields t1, t2 (u has space to hold the larger of T1, T2)

<u>Danger</u>:
```c++
T1 x; U u;
u.t1 = x;
T2 y = u.t2; // UB
```
Unions must be used consistently - must remember which field of the union is active.
Typically - discriminator variable

Unions:
	- Not recommended for general use - potential for UB
	- disciplined, controlled use within a library, not so bad.

Traditional vector/string layout:
```c++
class string {
// Short String Optimization(SSO)
	size_t n;
	size_t cap;
	char *theString;
};
```
SSO:
	- use this space as an array of chars, if n is small.
	- the size, n, can also be the discriminator.

```c++
class string {
	struct S {
		size_t cap;
		char *theString;
	};
	// n >= sizeof(S), use S, else use arr
	size_t n;
	union {
		S s;
		char arr[sizeof(S)];
	}
};
 ```
<u>Q</u>: Assuming size_t's ptrs are 8 bytes, how long a string can SSO hold?
<u>A</u>: S would occupy 16 bytes, so that's 15 chars + null terminator

<u>But (trick)</u>: ...
What is we store n last, instead of first? (Note: assumes big-endian architecture)
If the string is short -  the first 3 bytes of n will 0, so the first byte of n can be the null terminator!
Then we could actually hold 16 bytes + null terminator
