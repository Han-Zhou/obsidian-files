*Extracting substrings*:
	- `str::substr` creates a new string with the substring's chars in it. - new heap allocation(or SSO)
	- Can we do better? What if we know the substring will not be mutated? Or at least can only shrink?

Consider:
```c++
class string_view {
	const char *start;
	size_t n;
};
```
A <u>non-owning</u> slice of a string.
	- Points to a position in an existing string, or `char*`, or `vector<char>`, plus a length (to encode the end)
	- No allocation
	- Smaller than string - pass-by-value reasonable
	- copy operations are trivial - No big 5
What can we do with this? (I.e., what methods could we give `string_view`?)
	- iteration - begin/end - range-based loops
		- <u>Note</u>: no null-termination. - ranged-based looping is appropriate
	- extracting further substrings
		- remove_prefix (modify endpoint)
		- remove_suffix (modify endpoint)
		- substr - produce another `string_view`
	- find - search for chars/strings

We'll see this idea again ...





# Problem 20: Abstraction over containers

<u>Recall</u>:
map from Racket:
`(map f (list a b c)) ---> (list (f a) (f b) (f c))`

May want to do the same with vectors.
![[IMG_2815.jpeg]]

Assume: target has enough space to hold as much of source as we want to send.
```c++
template <typename T1, typename T2>
void transform(const vector<T1> &source, vector<T2> &target, T2 (*f) (T1)) {
	auto it = target.begin();
	for (auto &x : source) {
		*it = f(x);
		++it;
	}
}
```


OK, but:
	- what if we only want part of source?
	- What if we want to send source to the middle of target, not the beginning?

More general: use iterators
```c++
template <typename T1, typename T2>
void transform(vector<T1>::iterator start, vector<T1>::iterator finish, vector<T2>::iterator target, T2 (*f) (T1)) {
	while (start != finish) {
		*target = f(*start);
		++start;
		++target;
	}
}
```


Ok, but:
	- If I want to transform a list, I'll write the same code again.
	- What if I want to transform a list to a vector or vice versa

make type variables stand for the iterators, not the container elements.
But then how do we indicate the type of f?

```c++
template <typename InIter, typename OutIter, typename Fn>
void transform(InIter start, InIter finish, OutIter target, Fn f) {
	// body is the same
}
```

Works over vector iterators, list iterators, any kind of iterator.

`InIter`, `OutIter` can be any types that support `++, *, !=`, including ordinary pointers.

C++ will instantiate a template with any type that supports the operations being used on it.

`Fn` can be any type that supports function application.

E.g. 
```c++
class Plus {
	int n;
public:
	Plus(int n): n{n} { }
	int operator()(int m) {return n + m;}
};
Plus p{5};
cout << p(7); // 12
// function objects
```
