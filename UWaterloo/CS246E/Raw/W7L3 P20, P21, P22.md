```c++
class Plus {
	int n;
public:
	Plus (int n): n {n} { }
	int operator()(int m) {return n + m ;}
};
Plus p{5};
cout << p(7); // 12
transform(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin(), Plus{1});
```

<u>OR</u>
"lambda"
```c++
transform(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin(), [](int n){return n + 1;});
```

Semantics:
```c++
void f(T1 a, T2 b) {
	[a, &b](int x){body} . (arg)
}
```
translated to:
```c++
void f(T1 a, T2 b) {
	class ___ {
		T1 a;
		T2 &b;
		public:
			___(T1 a, T2 &b): a{a}, b{b} { }
			auto operator()(int x) const {
				body;
			}
	};
	
	___{a, b}.operator()(arg);
}
```


If the lambda is declared mutable, then operator() is not const.
Capture list - provides access to selected variables in the enclosing scope.






# Problem 21: What's better than one iterator?

Two iterators!

Consider `vector<T>::erase`
	- takes an iterator to the item
	- removes the item
	- shuffles the following items back
	- returns an iterator to the point to erasure
O(n) cost for shuffling. Fine.

<u>But</u> - what if you need to erase several consecutive items?
	- call erase repeatedly? Pay that O(n) cost multiple times.

<u>Faster</u> - shuffle the items up k positions (in one step each) where k is # of items being erased.

For this reason, we should make a "range" version of erase:
```c++
iterator vector<T>::erase(iterator first, iterator last);
```
erases items in `[first, last)` - only pays linear cost once

So maybe iterator isn't the right level of abstraction - maybe the right abstraction encapsulates a <u>pair</u> of iterators: a *range*


Consider: composing multiple functions on some input.
E.g. filter + transform (say, take all the odd numbers + square them)
```c++
auto odd = [](int n) {return n % 2 != 0;};
auto sqr = [](int n) {return n * n;};
vector v {___};
vector<int> w(v.size()), x(v.size());

// <algorithm>
copy_if(v.begin(), v.end(), w.begin(), odd);
transform(w.begin(), w.end(), x.begin(), sqr);
```

Two problems:
1) The calls don't compose well. Need 2 separate function calls, no way to chain them.
2) Needed a vector for intermediate storage
These functions return an iterator to the beginning to the output range.

What if instead we get a pair of iterators to the beginning + end of the output?
```c++
template <typename Iter> class Range {
	Iter start, finish;
public:
	Iter begin() {return start;}
	Iter end() {return finish;}
};
```

And what if instead `copy_if` + transform took a range, rather than a pair of iterators?
```c++
transform(copy_if(v, odd), sqr);
```
a range is anything with begin + end that produce iterators.
=> vector is a range!

function's now composable. But what about intermediate storage?
Who says we need it now?
A range only needs to <u>look</u> like it's sitting on top of a container.
Instead: - have the range fetch items <u>on demand</u>.

<u>filter</u>: on fetch: iterate through the range until you find an item that satisfies the predicate. Then return it!
<u>transform</u>: on fetch: fetch an item x from the range below. Then return f(x).

These range objects are called <u>views</u>. On-demand fetching. No intermediate storage.
These exist in the C++20 standard library.
```c++
import <ranges>
vector v{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
auto x = std::ranges::views::transform(
	std::ranges::views::filter(v, odd), sqr);
```

But it gets better!
`filter, transform` - called <u>range adapters</u>. They take a second form.
```c++
filter(pred), transform(f) 
// just supply the function, not the range
```
become callable objects, parameterized by a range.
E.g.
```c++
filter(pred)(R) , transform(f)(R)

// =>
filter(R, pred) , transform(R, f)

transform(filter(R, pred), f)
// equivalent to
transform(f)(filter(pred)(R))
```
Then operator | is defined so that `R|A` becomes `A(R)`
So `B(A(R)) = A(R)|B = R|A|B`

So we can write:
```c++
auto x = v | filter(odd) | transform(sqr)
```
Just like a Linux pipeline!





# Problem 22: Heterogeneous Data

I want a mixture of types in my vector.
	- Can't do this with a template (or at least, not obviously)
e.g. `vector<template <typename T> T> v;` -- Wrong!
	- not allowed - templates are compile-time entities - don't exist at run-time.
```c++
class MediaPlayer {
	template <typename T> T nowPlaying; // Wrong! Can't do this
};
```

What's available in C: unions, `void*` - not type-safe.

Items in a heterogenous collection will usually have something in common.
e.g. provide a common interface
Can be viewed as different "kinds" of a more general "thing".
So have a vector of "thing"s , or a field of type "thing".

Using the standard cs246 example:
```c++
// Superclass or Base class
class Book {
	string title, author;
	int length;
public:
	Book(string title, string author, int length): ___ { }
	bool isHeavy() const  {return length > 100;}
	string getTitle() const {return title;}
	// etc.
};

// Subclass or Derived class
class Text: public Book {
	string topic;
public: 
	Text(string title, string author, int length, string topic):
		Book{title, author, length}, topic{topic} { }
	bool isHeavy() const {return length > 200;}
	string getTopic() const {return topic;}
};


class Comic: public Book {
	string hero;
public:
	...
	bool isHeavy() const {return length > 50;}
	...
};
```

Subclasses inherit all members (fields + members) of their Superclass.
All three classes have files title, author, length, methods, getTitle, ..., isHeavy

... Except this doesn't work: private in Book - Text/Comic <u>cannot</u> access it.
