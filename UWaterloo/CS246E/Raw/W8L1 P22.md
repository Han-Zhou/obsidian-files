```c++
class Comic: public Book {
	...
public:
	...
	bool isHeavy() const {return length > 50;} // length private in book
}
...
// except that this dosn't work.
```
- except that this doesn't work.
- Comic cannot access length

<u>2 options</u>:
1) 
```c++
class Book {
	string title, author;
protected:
	int length;
	// accessible only to this class and its subclasses
public:
	...
};
```
2) call public method
```c++
bool Comic::isHeavy() const {
	return getLength() > 50;
}
```

<u>Recommend option 2</u>:
	- You have no control over what subclasses might do
	- protected weakens encapsulation; cannot enforce invariants on protected fields.

If you want subclasses to have privileged access:
	- keep the fields private.
	- provide protected `get___`/`set___` methods.


Updated object construction / destruction sequence
	<u>Creation</u>:
		1) Space is allocated
		2) Superclass part is constructed
		3) Fields constructed in declaration order
		4) Constructor body runs
	<u>Destruction</u>:
		1) Destructor body runs
		2) Fields destructed in reverse declaration order
		3) Superclass part is destructed
		4) Space deallocated


Type compatibility: Texts + Comics are special kinds of Book, should be usable in place of Books.
E.g. 
```c++
Book b = Comic{___, ___, 75, ___};
```
Method calls: 
```c++
b.isHeavy(); // false! 75 is a heavy Comic, but not a heavy Book
```
If b is a Comic, why is b acting like a Book?
	- Because b is a Book.
	- Consequence of stack-allocated objects

Keeps only the Book part - Comic part is chopped off. 
	- "Slicing"
	- So it really is just a Book now. `Book::isHeavy` runs.
Slicing happens even if superclass + subclass are the same size.


Similarly, if you want to collect your Books:
```c++
vector<Book> library;
library.push_back(Comic{...});
```
only the Book parts will be pushed - not a heterogeneous collection.

But consider: 
```c++
void f(Book books[]) // Raw arrays
Comic comics[] = {...}
f(comics) //*
```
\*:  Will succeed - But never do this!
(size of Comics and Books are different - memory may be misaligned)



Slicing does not happen through ptrs.
```c++
Book *bp = new Comic{___, ___, 75, ___};
```
![[IMG_2855.jpg]]

```c++
bp->isHeavy(); // still false
```
<u>Rule</u>: the choice of which version of the method to run is based on the type of the <u>ptr</u> (static type), not the object (dynamic type)

Why? Cheaper.
C++ design principle: If you don't use it, you shouldn't have to pay for it.
	- If you want something more expensive, you have to ask for it.
To make `*bp` act like a Comic when it is a Comic:
```c++
class Book {
	...
public:
	virtual bool isHeavy() const {...}
}
```

```c++
class Comic {
	...
public:
	bool isHeavy() const overide {...}
};
bp->isHeavy(); // true!
```

From now on, assume `isHeavy` is `virtual`

Can now have a true heterogeneous collection.
```c++
vector<Book *> library;
library.push_back(new Book {...});
library.push_back(new Comic {...});
```
(even better : `vector<unique_ptr<Book>> library;`)

```c++
int HowManyHeavy(const vector<Book *> &v) {
	int count = 0;
	for (auto &b : v) {
		if (b->isHeavy()) // *
			++count;
	}
	return count;
}
```
\*: the correct version of `isHeavy` always runs, even though we don't know what's in the vector, and the items are probably not all the same type.
*Polymorphism*


How do virtual methods "work"? And why are they more expensive?
Implementation-dependent, but the following is typical:
![[IMG_2856.jpg]]


Non-virtual methods => ordinary function calls
If there is at least 1 virtual method:
	- Compiler creates a table of function pointers - one per class - the vtable.
	- Each object contains a pointer to its class' vtable - the vptr.
	- Calling virtual method => follow the vptr to the vtable, follow the function ptr to the correct function.
vptr is often the first "field". - So that a subclass object still looks like a superclass object. - So the program know where the vptr is.
-> So the virtual method incur a cost in time (extra ptr deref) and in space (each obj gets a vptr)
