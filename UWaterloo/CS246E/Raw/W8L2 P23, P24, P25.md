# Problem 23: I'm leaking!

Consider:
```c++
class X {
	int *a;
public:
	X(int n): a{new int[n]} { }
	~X() {delete [] a;}
}


class Y: public X {
	int *b;
public:
	Y(int n, int m): X{n}, b{new int[m]} { }
	~Y() {delete [] b;}
}
```
<u>Note</u>: Y's destructor will call X's destructor (Step 3)


```c++
X *px = new Y{3, 4};
delete px; // Leaks!! Why?
```
-> Calls X's destructor, but not Y's

<u>Solution</u>:
```c++
class X {
	...
public:
	...
	virtual ~X() {delete [] n;}
}
```
-> No more leak!

<u>Always</u> make the destructor virtual in classes that are meant to be superclasses
	- Even if the destructor does nothing.
		- You never know what the subclass might do, so you make sure its destructor gets called.
	- Also, always give your virtual destructor an implementation.
		- Even if empty. It will be called by subclass destructor.

If a class is <u>not</u> meant to be a superclass - no need to incur the cost of virtual methods unnecessarily
	- Leave the destructor non-virtual, but declare the class <u>final</u>.
```c++
class X final { // cannot be subclassed
	...
}
```





# Problem 24: If a class has no objects ...

```c++
class Student {
	...
public:
	virtual float fees() const;
};


class RegularStudent: public Student {
public:
	float fees() const override; // Regular Student fees
};


class CoopStudent: public Student {
public:
	float fees() const override; // Co-op Student fees
}
```

What should `Student::fees` do?
-> Don't know - every Student should be regular or co-op.

<u>Solution</u>: Explicitly give `Student::fees` no implementation.
```c++
class Student { // **
public:
	virtual float fees() const = 0; // *
}
```
\*: called a *pure virtual method*
\*\*: called an *abstract class*

Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
```c++
Student s; // Error
new Student; // Error
```
Can point to instances of concrete (not abstract) subclasses:
```c++
Student *s = new Regular Student; // OK
```

Subclasses of abstract classes are abstract, unless they implement all pure virtual methods (note: a subclass can implement some virtual methods, and still be abstract).

Abstract classes :
	- Used to organize concrete classes
	- Can contain common fields, methods, default implementations



# Problem 25: The copier is broken. Again.

How do copies + moves interact with inheritance?

<u>Copy constructor</u>: 
```c++
Text::Text(const Text &other): Book{other}, topic{other.topic} { }
```

<u>Move constructor</u>:
```c++
Text::Text(Text &&other): Book{std::move(other)}, topic{std::move(other.topic)} { }
```

<u>Copy assignment</u>:
```c++
Text &Text::operator=(const Text &other) {
	Book::operator=(other);
	topic = other.topic;
	return *this;
}
```

<u>Move assignment</u>:
```c++
Text &Text::operator=(Text &&other) {
	Book::operator=(std::move(other));
	topic = std::move(other.topic);
	return *this;
}
```
