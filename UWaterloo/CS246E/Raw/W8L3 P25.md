But consider:
```c++
Boo *b1 = new Text{...}, *b2 = new Text{...};
*b1 = *b2;
```

what happens?
Only the Boo part is copied
	- <u>partial assignment</u>
	- topic doesn't match title + author
	- object is corrupted

Possible solution?
Make `operator=` virtual
```c++
class Boo {
	...
public:
	virtual Boo &operator=(const Boo &other) {...}
	...	
};

class Text: public Boo {
	...
public:
	Text &operator=(const Boo &other) override {...}
	// *
};
```
\*: must take Boo for signature to match!
	- or else it's not an override
	- Could also pass in a Comic - big problem
We'll revisit this shortly


**Another Solution**:
Make all superclasses <u>abstract</u>
![[IMG_2862.jpg]]


```c++
class AbstractBoo {
protected:
	AbstractBoo &operator=(const AbstractBoo &other) {...}
	// non-virtual
	...

	virtual ~AbstractBoo()= 0; //**
};

class Text: public AbstractBoo {
	string topic;
public:
	Text &operator=(const Text &other) {
		AbstractBoo::operator=(other);
		topic = other.topic;
		return *this;
	}
}
```
`operator=` non-virtual 
	=> no mixed assignment
`AbstractBoo::operator=` no accessible to outsider
	=> no partial assignment
	`*b1 = *b2` won't compile.

\*\*: If there's no good candidate for pure virtual methods, make the destructor as such.






# Problem 26: What kind of Boo is this?

For simplicity, assume the hierarchy:

     Boo 
Text            Comic



**The C++ casting operators**:

C syle casting:
	- forces expr to be treated as type type
```C
(type) expr
// e.g.
int *p;
int q = (int) p;
```


1) *Static_cast*
		- For conversion with a well-defined semantics.
e.g. 
```c++
void f(int a);
void f(double a); // calls this
int x;
f(static_cast<double>(x)); 
```

e.g. superclass ptr to subclass ptr
```c++
Boo *b = new Text{...};
Text *t = static_cast<Text*>(b);
```
<u>You have to know</u> that b really points at a Text.
Otherwise UB.


2) *reinterpret_cast*
		- for casts without a well-defined sementics
		- unsafe, implementation-dependent
e.g.
```C++
Boo *b = new Boo {...};
int *p = reinterpret_cast<int*>(b);
```



3) *const_cast*
		- For adding/removing cast
		- the only C++ cast that can " const away const"
```c++
void g(Boo &b); // *
void f(const Boo &b) {
	g(const_cast<Boo &>(b));
}
```
\*: g may modify b, but assume that we know that under the circumstances when f calls g, it won't



4) *dynamic_cast*
		- What if we don't know whether pb points to a Text?
		- static_cast is not safe
```c++
Boo *pb = ___;
Text *pt = dynamic_cast<Text *>(pb);
```
If `*pb` is a Text or a subclass of Text, cast succceeds, pt points at the object.
Else `pt == nullptr`
```c++
if (pt) {
	...
	pt->getTopic();
	...
}
else // not a Text
```

e.g. 
```c++
void whatIsIt(Boo *pb) {
	if (dynamic_cast<Text*>(pb))
		cout << "Text";
	else if (dynamic_cast<Comic*>(pb))
		cout << "Comic";
	else 
		cout << "Bool"
}
```
Not good style!
	- what happens when you create a new Boo type?

Dynamic reference casting:
```c++
Boo *pb = ___;
Text &t = dynamic_cast<Text&>(*pb);
```
If `*pb` is a Text - OK.
else throws std::bad_cast

NOTE: 
dynamic_casting works by accessing an object's runtime type information (RTTI)
	- This is stored in the vtable for the class
=> Can only use dynamic_cast on objects with >= 1 virtual method.

Dynamic ref casting offers a possible "solution" to the polymorphic assignment problem.
```c++
Text &Text::operator=(const Boo &other) { // virtual
	const Text& tother = dynamic_cast<const Text&>(other);
	Boo::operator=(other);
	topic = tother.topic;
	return *this;
}
```
