```c++
vector v;
v.push_back(4);
v.push_back(5);
v[2]; // out of bounds (UB - may or may not crash)
```

Can we make this safer?

Adding bounds check to operator\[] - may be needlessly expensive
Could have a second, safer, fetch operator.
```c++
class vector {
	...
	public:
		int &at(size_t i) {
			if (i < n) {
				return theVector[i]
			}
			else //what? ...
			// v.at(2) still wrong - what should happen?
		}
}
```
returning any int - looks like a non-error
returning a non-int - not type-correct
crash the program? - Can we do better?
-> Don't return, don't crash.

<u>Solution:</u> Raise an *exception*
```c++
class range_error {};
class vector {
	int &at (size_t i) {
		if (i < n) {...}
		else throw range_error{};
		// construct an object of type range_error and "throw" it.
	}
}
```

<u>Client's options:</u>
1. Do nothing - 
	```c++
	vector v;
	v.push_back(1);
	v.at(1); // the exception will crash the program.
	```
2.  catch it
```c++
	try {
		vector v;
		v.at(0);
	}
	// r is the thrown object
	catch (range_error &r) {
		// do something
	}
```
3. let your caller catch it.


<u>Recall</u>:
Exceptions
3. let your caller catch it.
```c++
int f() {
	vector v;
	v.push_back(1);
	v.at(1);
}

int g() {
	try {f();}
	catch (range-error &r) {
		// do something
	}
}
```
Exception will <u>propagate</u> back through the call chain until a handler is found.
- called <u>unwinding</u> the stack.
- If no handler found, program aborts.
- Control resumes after the catch block. (Problem code is not retried)

What happens if a constructor throws an exception?
- Object is considered partially constructed.
- Destructor will not run on partially constructed objects.

<u>Example</u>:
```c++
class C {...};
class D {
	C a;
	C b;
	int *c;
public:
	D() {
		c = new int[10];
		...
		if (...) throw some thing; //*
	}
	~D() {
		delete [] c;
	}
};

D d;
```
At `*`, the D object is not fully constructed, so `~D()` will not run on d.
But - a and b <u>are</u> fully constructed, so their destructors <u>will</u> run.
So if a constructor wants to throw, it must clean up after itself.
```c++
D() {
	c = new int[10];
	...
	if (...) {
		delete [] c;
		throw something;
	}
}
```


What happens if a destructor throws? <u>Trouble</u>
- By default - program aborts <u>immediately</u>. `std::terminate` is called.
- If you really want a throwing destructor, tag it with `noexcept(false)`
- But watch out ...
```c++
class myexn{};
class C {
	...
public:
	~C() noexcept(false) {
		throw myexn{};
	}
};

void h() {
	C c1; 
	// destructor for c1 throws at the end of h
}

void g() {
	C c2;
	h();
	// unwind through g
	// destructor for c2 throws as we leave g.
}

void f() {
	try {
		g();
	}
	catch(myexn &exn) {
		...
	}
}
```
- no handler yet
- now <u>2</u> unhandled errors.
- <u>immediate</u> termination guaranteed.

<u>Never</u> let destructors throw. Swallow the exceptions if necessary.

<u>Also Note</u>: you can throw any value - not just objects.
