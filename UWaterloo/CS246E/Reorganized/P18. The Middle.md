If we want to insert an item into the <u>middle</u> of a collection - say by index
For vectors:
- easy to find the place to insert
- shuffling cost (unavoidable)
For lists:
- finding the insertion point requires linear search
- no shuffling cost
Using iterators instead of indices should be about the same for vectors and faster for lists.

```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
	...
public:
	iterator insert(iterator posn, const T &x) {
		ptrdiff_t offset = posn - begin();
		increaseCap();
		posn = begin() + offset;
		if (n > 0)
			new (end()) T(std::move_if_noexcept(*(end() - 1)));
		++n;
		for (iterator it = end() - 1; it != posn; --it) {
			*it = std::move_if_noexcept(*(it - 1));
		}
		*posn = x;
		return posn;
	}
}
```

<u>Exception safe?</u>
Assuming T's copy/move constructor + copy/move assignment are exception safe (at least basic guarantee), insert offers the basic guarantee.
-> may got a partially-shuffled vector, but it will be a valid vector.

<u>Note</u>: if you have other iterators pointing at the vector:
![[IMG_1973.jpg]]
it2 will now point at a different item.

<u>Convention</u>: after a call to insert or erase, all iterators pointing after the point of the insertion or erasure are considered invalid + should not be used.
<u>Similarly</u> - if a reallocation happens, <u>all</u> iterators pointing at the vector can become invalid.
<u>Exercises</u> - erase, emplace



<u>BUT</u> - that means there's a problem with push_back. If placement new throws, the vector is the same, but iterators might have been invalidated!

<u>To fix</u>: Don't throw away the old array until you have placed the item.
```c++
void push_back(const T &x) {
	if (n == vb.cap) {
		vector_base vb2{2 * vb.cap};
		new (vb2.v + b) T(x);
		try {
			uninitialized_copy_or_move(vb2.v, vb2.v + n, vb.v);
		}
		catch (...) {
			(vb2.v + n)->~T();
			throw;
		}
		int m = n;
		clear();
		swap(vb, vb2);
		n = m + 1;
	}
	else {...}
}
```
