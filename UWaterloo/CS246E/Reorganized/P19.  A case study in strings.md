So, if a string is a sequence of chars ... can we just use `vector<char>` when we want strings?
<u>Ans</u>: Yes, in principle, but there might be some reasons not to.

Primarily, vector functions as a container of items that may not have much to do with each other.

But in a string, it's the elements taken together as a group that makes a string what it is.
<u>E.g.</u> strings are more likely than vectors to:
- be appended to one another
- be compared lexicographically
- be searched for a substring
- have a substring extracted
All of these are about chars in the sequence, in conjunction with their neighbours.
So a string would likely support a different interface from vector.
