What if we forget to call `make_vector`? - Uninitialized structure.
What if we forget to call `dispose`? - Memory leak.

*How can we make this more robust?*

## Intro to Classes

First concept in OOP. -functions inside of structs.

Example:
```c++
struct Student {
	int assns, mt, final;
	float grade() {
		return assns * 0.4 + mt * 0.2 + final * 0.4;
	}
};
```
structures that can contain functions - called **classes**
functions inside structs - called **methods**
instances of a class -  called **objects**
```c++
Student s {90, 80, 70};
//class: Student, object: s
cout << s.grade(); //<- method call
```

What do `assns, mt, final` mean inside of `grade(){...}`?
- fields of the <u>current</u> object - the receiver of the method call.
\
Formally - methods differ from functions in that methods take an implicit parameter called <u>this</u> that is a pointer to the receiver object.
In the example,
```c++
this == &s
```

Could have written(equiv.)
```c++
struct Student {
	float grade() {
		return this->assns * 0.4 + this->mt * 0.2 + this->final * 0.4; 
	}
}
```



*Initializing Objects:*
```c++
Student s{90, 75, 80}; // C-style struct initialization - field by field
```
Ok, but limited.

Better - <u>initialization method</u> - a **constructor**
```c++
struct Student {
	int assns, mt, final;
	Student(int assns, int mt, int final) {
		this->assns = assns;
		this->mt = mt;
		this->final = final;
	}
};

Student s{90, 75, 80};
// calls the constructor with args 90, 75, 80
```
<u>NOTE</u>: Once a constructor is defined, c-style field initialization is not available.

Equiv:
```c++
Student s = Student{90, 75, 80};
```

<u>Heap</u>:
```c++
Student *p = new Student{90,75, 80};
```


Advantages of constructors:
- default params
- overloading
- sanity checks
-e.g.
```c++
struct Student {
	// ...
	Student(int assns = 0; int mt = 0; int final = 0) // default values 
	{
		this->assns = assns;
	}
	
};

Student s2{70}; // 70,0,0
Student newkid; //0,0,0
// CANT DO Student newkid();
```
\
<u>NOTE</u>: Every class comes with a built-in *default constructor* (i.e. zero-arg)

e.g. `Node n;` -> calls default constructor
-default constructs all fields that are objects
-does nothing in this case (int and Node \*)

Goes away if you provide any constructor.

e.g. 
```c++
struct Node {
	int data;
	Node *next;
	Node(int data, Node *next = nullptr) {
		this->data = data; //...
	}
};

Node n{3}; //allowed
Node m; //Error: no default constructor
```


Object creation steps - when an object is created:
<u>4 steps</u>:
1) Space is allocated
2) (later)
3) Fields constructed in declaration order (field constructors are called for fields that are objects)
4) Constructor body runs

Field initialization should happen in step 3, but constructor body is step 4.
Consequence: - object fields could be initialized twice.

E.g.
```c++
import<string>;

struct Student {
	//...
	string name; // object
	Student (string name, ...) {
		this->name = name; //etc.
	}
};

Student s{"some-name", 90,90,90};
// name default-constructed in step 3 ("")
// then reassigned in setp 4


```



To fix: *Member Initialization List (MIL)*
```c++
struct Student {
	...
	Student(string name, int assns, int mt, int final): name{name}, assns{assns}, mt{mt}, final{final} {...}
		//step 3.               and step 4
}
```


MIL <u>must</u> be used for fields that are:
- constants
- references
- objects without a default constructor
<u>Should</u> be used as much as possible.

<u>Careful</u>: single argument constructors
```c++
struct Node{
	...
	Node(int data, Node *next = nullptr): data{data}, next{next}
	{}
};
```
Problem: single-arg constructors create implicit conversions.
```c++
Node n{4}; //OK
Node n = 4; //OK, int implicitly converted to Node

void f(Node n);
f(4) //Problem: - this is OK - maybe trouble
```
Can fix it by throwing in keyword explicit.
