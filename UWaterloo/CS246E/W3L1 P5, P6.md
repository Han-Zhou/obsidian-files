<u>Recall</u>:
```c++
struct Node {
	...
	explicit Node(): ... {} //disables implicit conversion
}

// ERROR
Node n{4};

// OK
Node n = 4;

void f(Node n);

// ERROR
f(4);

// OK
f(Node{4});
```


*Object Destruction*
- a method called the <u>destructor</u> runs automatically
- build-in dtor - calls dtors on all fields that are objects.

Object destruction - 4 steps
1. dtor body runs
2. fields destructed (destructor called on fields that are objects) in reverse declaration order
3. (later)
4. space deallocated

```c++
struct Node {
	int data;
	Node *next;
}
```
what does the built-in destructor do?
-Nothing. Neither field is an object
```c++
Node *n = new Node{3, new Node{4, nullptr}};
delete n; // only deletes first node
```

Writing our own destructor:
```c++
struct Node{
	...
	~Node() {
		delete next;
	}
}

delete n // now frees the whole list
```

Also:
```c++
{
Node n{1, new Node{2, new Node{3, nullptr}}};
// 1st is stack-allocated, rest are heap-allocated.
} // scope of n ends, whole list is freed.

```

Objects:
- a constructor always runs when they are created.
- a destructor always runs when they are destroyed.


Back to the vector example - turn into a class:
```c++
// vector.cc

export module vector;
namespace cs246e {

	export struct vector {
		int *theVector;
		size_t n, cap;
		vector();
		size_t size();
		int &itemAt(size_t i);
		void push_back(int n);
		void pop_back();
		~vector();
	}
}
```

```c++
// vector-impl.cc
module vector;
void increaseCap(cs246e::vector &v) {...}

cs246e::vector::vector(): theVector{new int[1]}, n{0}, cap{1} {}

size_t cs246e::vector::size() {return n;}

// etc

cs246e::vector::~vector() {delete [] theVector;}
```

```c++
// main
import vector;
using cs246e::vector;
int main() {
	vector v; // constructor automatically called - no make_vector
	v.push_back(1);
	v.push_back(10);
	v.itemAt(0) = 2;
} // no dispose - the destroctor cleans v up.
```


# Problem 6: The copier is broken
```c++
vector v;
v.push_back(100);
...
vector w = v; // allowed - constructs w as a copy of v
w.itemAt(0); //100
v.itemAt(0) = 200;
w.itemAt(0); //200
```
Shallow copy: v and w share data

`vector w = v;` 
- constructs w as a copy of v.
- invokes the <u>copy constructor</u>

```c++
struct vector {
	...
	vector(const vector &other) {...} // copy constructor
};
```
compiler-supplied copy constructor - copies all fields (shallow copy)
If want deep copy - write your own copy constructor.

Copy constructor for `Node`: (vector exercise)
```c++
struct Node {
	int data;
	Node *next;
	...
	Node (const Node &other): 
		data{other.data}, 
		next{other.next ? new Node{*other.next} : nullptr}
	{}
}
```


```c++
vector v;
vector w;
...
w = v; // copy, but not a construction
		// copy assignment operator
```
compiler-supplied - copies each field (shallow)
				-leaks w's old data.

Deep copy assignments: (vector as exercise)
```c++
struct Node {
	int data;
	Node *next;
	...
	Node &operator=(const Node &other) {
		data = other.data;
		delete next; //assumes a deep destructor
		next = other.next ? new Node {*other.next} : nullptr;
		// assumes a deep copy-constructor
		return *this;
	}
};
```

Wrong / Dangerous

Consider:
```c++
Node n {...};
n = n;

// Use cases
*p = *q;
nodes[i] = nodes[j];
```
This destroys n's data + then tries to copy it.
Must always ensure that operator= works in the case of self-assignment.

```c++
Node &Node::operator=(const Node &other) {
	if (this == &other)
		return *this;
	// otherwise as before
}
```
