<u>Recall</u>:
```c++
vector<int> v; // empty
vector<int> v{5}; // 0 0 0 0 0
vector<int> v{3, 5}; // 5 5 5
```
Better - what about true array-style initialization?

```c++
import <initializer_list>;
template <typename T> class vector {
	...
public:
	...
	vector();
	vector(size_t n, T x = {}): ...

	vector(std::initializer_list<T> init): 
		n{init.size()}, cap{init.size()}, theVector {new T[cap]} {
		size_t i = 0;
		for (auto t : init) theVector[i++] = t;
	}
};

vector<int> v {1,2,3,4,5};

// But also:
vector v{1,2,3,4,5};
// If T can be deduced from the types of the args, we can omit it!

vector<int> v; // empty - int is required here
vector v {5}; // 5, int omitted
vector v {3, 5}; // 3 5, int ommitted
```
Default constructors take precedence over initializer list constructors, which take precedence over other constructors.

To get the other constructors to run - need round bracket init.
```c++
vector<int> v(5); // 0 0 0 0 0
vector v(3, 5); // 5 5 5
```

A note on cost: items in an init list are stored in contiguous memory (begin returns a pointer)

So we are using one array to build another - 2 copies in memory.

Note:
- initializer-lists are meant to be immutable
- do not try to modify their contents
- do not use them as data structures

But also note: - only one allocation in vector, not several
- no doubling of reallocating, as there was with a sequence of push_backs
