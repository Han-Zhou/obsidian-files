<u>Recall</u>:
```c++
vector<int> v; // empty
vector<int> v{5}; // 0 0 0 0 0
vector<int> v{3, 5}; // 5 5 5
```
Better - what about true array-style initialization?

```c++
import <initializer_list>;
template <typename T> class vector {
	...
public:
	...
	vector();
	vector(size_t n, T x = {}): ...

	vector(std::initializer_list<T> init): 
		n{init.size()}, cap{init.size()}, theVector {new T[cap]} {
		size_t i = 0;
		for (auto t : init) theVector[i++] = t;
	}
};

vector<int> v {1,2,3,4,5};

// But also:
vector v{1,2,3,4,5};
// If T can be deduced from the types of the args, we can omit it!

vector<int> v; // empty - int is required here
vector v {5}; // 5, int omitted
vector v {3, 5}; // 3 5, int ommitted
```
Default constructors take precedence over initializer list constructors, which take precedence over other constructors.

To get the other constructors to run - need round bracket init.
```c++
vector<int> v(5); // 0 0 0 0 0
vector v(3, 5); // 5 5 5
```

A note on cost: items in an init list are stored in contiguous memory (begin returns a pointer)

So we are using one array to build another - 2 copies in memory.

Note:
- initializer-lists are meant to be immutable
- do not try to modify their contents
- do not use them as data structures

But also note: - only one allocation in vector, not several
- no doubling of reallocating, as there was with a sequence of push_backs


In general: if you know how big your vector is likely to be, you can save reallocation costs by requesting method up front.

```c++
template <typename T> class vector {
	...
public:
	...
	void reserve(size_t newCap) {
		if (cap < newCap) {
			T *newVec = new T[newCap];
			for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i)
				newVec[i] = theVector[i];
			delete [] theVector;
			theVector = newVec;
			cap = newCap;
		}
	}
}
```

<u>Exercise</u>: rewrite push_back to use reserve instead of increase cap
```c++
vector<int> v;
v.reserve(1000);
v.push_back(-);
// can do 1000 push_backs without needing to reallocate
```



# Problem 14: Actually ... I want a vector of posns
```c++
struct Posn {
	int x, y;
	Posn(int x, int y): x{x}, y{y} {}
};
int main() {
	vector<Posn> v; // won't compile! Why not?
}
```

vector's constructor:
```c++
template <typename T> vector<T>::vector():
	n{0}, cap{1}, theVector{new T[cap]} { }// creates an array of T objects
```
- Which T objects will be stored in the array?
C++ <u>always</u> calls a constructor when creating an object.
- which constructor gets called? - Default constructor T{ }
- Posn doesn't have one.

How can we create a vector of Posns?

Need to seperate memory allocation (object creation step 1)
from object initialization (steps 2 - 4)

<u>Allocation</u>: 
```c++
void *operator new(size_t n)
```
- allocates n bytes - no initialization
- returns void*

<u>Note</u>: in `C`: `void *` implicitly converts to any pointer type
in `C++`: the conversion requires a cast

<u>Initialization</u>: "placement new"
```c++
new (addr) type
```
- constructs an instance of 'type' at 'addr'
- does <u>not</u> allocate memory.
